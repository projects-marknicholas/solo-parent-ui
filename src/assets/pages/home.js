These includes economic pressure, social acceptability, performance of parental responsibilities, need for resources and support services.
              The service is a response to the emerging needs of the increasing population of solo parents particularly those who are at risk and disadvantaged. There are different interventions that address the major problems encountered by solo parents to be able to cope with solo parenting.
              The project shall be a partnership between and among the DSWD - Social Technology Bureau, the Regional Offices and the Local Government Units where the project will be implemented.
